# LaserEyesBTC

This repository contains a simple Angular frontend and Express backend that demonstrates a basic Lightning Network integration. The frontend lets users add "laser eyes" to an uploaded picture while the backend provides endpoints for creating and checking LNbits invoices.

```
backend/  - Express server exposing /invoice endpoints
frontend/ - Angular application with the laser editor
```

Both projects include Dockerfiles for containerized builds.
